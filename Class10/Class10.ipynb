    "For the first three weeks you been learning the basics of programming in Python -- enough to begin exploring further on your own. In the final week of this module I want to give you a taste of the real power of Python programming. **Do not worry if you don't understand everything.** Just follow along in the notebooks to see the possibilities. Some of the tasks will continue to follow our Martian theme, but I'll include some down-to-Earth examples to get you thinking about ways you might use programming in your own career (assuming you don't go to Mars).\n",

    "I think you'll be surprised at how much you actually do understand, and I hope you'll be inspired to investigate further on your own!  But some of this stuff is tricky, so don't rush through the notebooks.  ** Read everything carefully.**\n",

Each week I download and plot their picks automatically and determine a winner by calculating who is closest to the actual biggest earthquake of the past 7 days. Doing this by hand would take considerable effort, but it only takes me a minute to run my Python script.  Automating boring stuff is one of the advantages of learning to program.\n",

    "Many web pages display data in the form of a table, but do not provide any type of API, RESTful or unRESTful. Sure, you could cut and paste from the web page to get your data, but if the web page changes frequently cutting and pasting could get real old, real fast. \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is to write a \"web scraper,\" which is a program that pulls the data directly from the web page. The most popular Python module written to scrape the web is called [beautiful soup](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/beautifulsoup/beautifulsoup-4-python), a reference to Lewis Carroll and the Mock Turtle.  Since the beautiful soup module is designed to work directly with web pages, it helps to know something about HTML and XML, the formating language of the web. Don't worry, you only need to know a little.\n",

    "If you're just after tables, however, the pandas module can generally do the trick. First we use the urllib module to read the raw HTML from the target webpage.\n",
