    "One common approach is install all of the necessary components on our computer.  Python is free, so we could certainly do this, but installing, configuring and updating python presupposes some familiarity with computer operating systems and programming. An alternative approach, one we'll take in this class, is to go with a Cloud Computing setup where experts have intalled all the necessary software, checked for compatibiity, and ensure that everything is kept up to date. This approach has the added advantage that it pushes all of the computation into the cloud, so it doesn't matter if your computer is old and slow, or what type of computer you have -- mac, PC, or chromebook -- as long as you can run a web browser you'll be fine.\n",
