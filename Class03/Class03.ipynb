Integers are whole numbers, no decimal point. The numbers 1, 28 and -4 are all integrers. Floating point numbers have decimals. The number 2.3 is a floating point number; so is 3.1415. Python uses integers when it can because they take less space in memory and integer calculations are ever so slightly faster. The distinction between the two, however, is generally not something you need to worry about. Note the type() function will tell you what type of data a Python variable contains."
