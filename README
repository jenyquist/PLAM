This project is a set of Jupyter Notebooks for teaching a four-week Python
module to non-science majors as part of Temple University's General Education
Curriculum. The module is called "Program Like a Martian" (PLAM) and it included
in the full-semester course "Demystifying Technology." This module will
be taught for the first time in the Spring Semester of 2017.
